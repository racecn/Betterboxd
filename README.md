# Betterboxd
A Firefox extension that enhances your Letterboxd browsing experience with practical features:

- **Quick Year Display**: Shows release years on top of movie posters, eliminating the need to hover over each film.
- **External Search Integration**: Adds convenient buttons to search for any film on your preferred streaming platforms or movie databases using the film's title and release year. (or your own custom search formatting!)

## Roadmap
The following features are planned for future updates:

- **Watchlist Indicators**: Visual indicators showing which films are already on your watchlist.
- **Watchlist Filtering**: Option to hide films that are already in your watchlist.
- **Basic Accessibility**: Improved color contrast options for better readability and compliance with accessibility standards.
- **Personalized Overlay Placement**: Allow users to pick and choose which movie posters are overlayed with the Betterboxd functionality.
  
## Known Issues
- Films that have a 4 digit number as the last part of their title show that number instead of the release year

- Letterboxd has added a function to zoom in on the posters just by clicking them when on the details page, which makes the touch target of the overlay
