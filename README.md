# Betterboxd

This is a Firefox addon to add a year display under each preview poster on a movie, as sometimes its annoying to hover over movies to get their release date

Adds an external link button that can immediately search the film's title and release year on any other platform you'd like.

Improves the color contrast choices made by Letterboxd
